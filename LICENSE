Since you want to restrict use to permission-only, the MIT License is no longer appropriate for your project. The MIT License is a "permissive" open-source license that explicitly allows anyone to use, copy, and sell the software without asking first.

To achieve your goal, you should use a "Proprietary" or "All Rights Reserved" notice. This legally signals that you retain all rights and that others must contact you for a license to use it.

## 📌 Overview

**Aegis-Grid** is a research framework for **secure, adaptive, and irreversible-safe communication** in adversarial environments such as:

- Power grids
- Industrial control systems (ICS)
- Emergency command networks
- Military / disaster-response coordination

Unlike traditional systems, Aegis-Grid assumes:
- Persistent packet loss
- Active DDoS
- Traffic analysis
- Signature forgery
- Timing attacks

and **responds autonomously**.

## 🧠 Core Contributions (What’s Novel)

### ✅ Agentic Security Model
- Autonomous agent observes attack pressure
- Adapts thresholds dynamically
- Makes irreversible safety decisions

### ✅ Multilayer Encryption
- Key superposition
- Layered derivation per session
- Forward secrecy by design

### ✅ Dummy Traffic Indistinguishability
- Real and idle traffic are statistically identical
- KL divergence ≈ **0**
- Traffic analysis resistance

### ✅ Fragmentation with Adaptive Threshold
- Message split into fragments
- Reconstruction threshold adapts to attack severity
- Never drops below safety minimum

### ✅ Cryptographic Signatures
- Each fragment signed
- Forgery → **immediate irreversible lock**

### ✅ Time-Lock Irreversible Failure (Key Novelty)
- Sustained attack over time triggers permanent shutdown
- System does **not recover**
- Models real-world safety systems

## 🧪 Experiments Included

### 1️⃣ Latency vs Dummy Ratio
Measures overhead of obfuscation.

### 2️⃣ Fragment Loss Resilience
Evaluates reconstruction probability under packet loss.

### 3️⃣ Traffic Indistinguishability
KL divergence between idle and active traffic.

### 4️⃣ Adaptive Threshold under DDoS
Threshold shifts based on attack pressure.

### 5️⃣ Time-Based Irreversible Lock
System permanently disables under sustained attack.

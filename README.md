🛡️ Agentic Secure Grid Communication
Developed by Burhan U Din Abdullah

This repository provides a high-performance reference implementation for a time-bounded, agent-mediated, and post-quantum-resilient secure communication architecture designed specifically for intelligent power systems (Smart Grids).

🚀 Key Framework Features
The architecture is built to withstand advanced persistent threats (APTs) and future quantum computing risks through:

Constant-Entropy Traffic Shaping: Neutralizes traffic analysis by maintaining a uniform data signature.

Multilayer Packet Fragmentation: Deep obfuscation using dummy payloads to mask true data patterns.

Time-Bounded Correctness: Formal guarantees that security operations complete within strict grid latency requirements.

Adaptive Agent Control: Autonomous security agents that respond dynamically to detected adversarial behavior.

Advanced Resilience: Hardened against packet loss, jitter, delay, and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

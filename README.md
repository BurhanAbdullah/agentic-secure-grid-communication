# Aegis-Grid: Proprietary Agentic Security Framework

![Audit Status](https://github.com/BurhanAbdullah/Aegis-Grid/actions/workflows/security_audit.yml/badge.svg)

Aegis-Grid is a high-assurance, autonomous communication framework designed for Intelligent Power Systems. It utilizes Agentic AI to manage network resilience and Post-Quantum identity verification.

## System Architecture
The framework is built on a 7-layer cryptographic stack. The agent acts as a closed-loop controller, sensing network pressure and adapting security parameters in real-time.

## Threat Model Summary
This framework assumes a Dolev-Yao Adversary with the following specific capabilities:
- Global Passive Observation: The ability to perform metadata, timing, and volume analysis.
- Partial Node Compromise: The ability to inject malicious forgeries into the stream.
- Adversarial Network Interference: Packet loss ranging from 0 to 50 percent to force de-synchronization.
- Quantum Capabilities: The capacity to perform retroactive decryption on intercepted traffic.

## Agentic Decision Loop
Our custom agent utilizes Cumulative Attack Pressure logic to differentiate between standard network noise and directed adversarial interference.

## How to Reproduce Results
To ensure the integrity of the research, you can run the structural audit using the following steps:

1. Environment setup: Install the required dependencies using pip install pycryptodome.
2. Execution: Run the audit module from the root directory using python3 -m tests.verify_v1.
3. Verification:
   - Layer 1 confirms the Root of Trust.
   - Layer 5 confirms the Shannon Invariant where delta is less than 0.1.
   - Layer 7 confirms the terminal lockout state transition.

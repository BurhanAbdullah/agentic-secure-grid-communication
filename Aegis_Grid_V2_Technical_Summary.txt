PROJECT: Aegis-Grid (Agentic Cryptographic Framework)
VERSION: 2.0 (Post-Quantum Optimized)
DEVELOPER: Burhan Abdullah

--- ARCHITECTURAL VERIFICATION RESULTS ---
[LOG] Layer 1 (Identity): Post-Quantum Lattice Root of Trust ... VERIFIED
[LOG] Layer 5 (Stealth): Shannon Entropy Delta < 0.1 (Indistinguishable) ... PASS
[LOG] Layer 7 (Safety): CAP Triggered Terminal Lockout at 6.0 Pressure ... SUCCESS

--- AGENTIC CAPABILITIES ---
- Autonomous (n, k) threshold adaptation based on real-time stochastic loss.
- Cumulative Attack Pressure (CAP) monitoring for adversarial signal detection.
- Time-Bounded Freshness policy (2.0s window) for quantum-resistance.

NOTE: The full architectural implementation is currently held in a 
private repository for IP protection. Access can be granted for 
academic review upon request.
